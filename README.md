# HextechAutomation

Manages League of Legends' Hextech loot directly on LEdge, without needing the League Client (LCU) at all.

Repo is only here for reference.

## Features

- Print all player loot, including hidden/legacy items
- Bulk craft keys from key fragments
- Bulk open all chests/capsules
- Cleanup/disenchant champion/champion shards, leaving some depending on ownership and mastery upgrades
- Bulk re-roll, e.g. emotes that can't be disenchanted
